# Wordle-Solver
Program in Java to assist a player in the online word-guessing game Wordle. 
Input your five-letter guess and the game’s response in tile colors (g, y, or r) to eliminate possible words. 
The algorithm will determine your “next best guess,” or word most likely to reduce the word bank by the greatest amount.

## Example Input:

You can choose to enter the program's calculated "next best guess," or a word of your own.
Then type the "key" corresponding to the tile colors the game produced after you entered your guess.

## Example Response:

The program will print the number of remaining possible words. It will also offer 10 of those possible words (or fewer, if only 6 words remain for example). Finally, it will print your "next best guess", or the guess most likely to shrink the possible word bank by the greatest amount.
